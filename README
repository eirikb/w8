w8
==

This is the mother of all Proof Of Concepts.

It's a JavaScript kernel with the name w8.
w8 either means 'weight' because it's a light weight kernel on top of a heavy weight VM,
or 'wait' because it might be horrible slow in runtime or to produce.

Build
-----

This will probably work:
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
$ sudo apt-get install grub2
$ sudo apt-get install qemu
$ make
$Â make run
